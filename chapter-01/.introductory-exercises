Suggest possible operations that would satisfy the given input and output types:

1)  Input type:     Vect n elem
    Output type:    Vect n elem


2)  Input type:     Vect n elem
    Output type:    Vect (n * 2) elem


3)  Input type:     Vect (1 + n) elem
    Output type:    Vect n elem


4)  Assume that `Bounded n` represents a number between zero and n - 1
    Input type:     Bounded n, Vect n elem
    Output type:    elem
